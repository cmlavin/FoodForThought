## Introduction

Food For Thought is ****.  The app can be accessed at http://foodforthought-flatiron.herokuapp.com/.

### `Gameplay`

After a player signs up or logs in to their account, they choose a category, difficulty, the number of questions, and the type of questions for the game.  Once the game starts the player will need to answer all of the questions before time runs out, otherwise the game will be over.  The amount of time is based on the number of questions in the game with 10 seconds allotted per question.  The number of points awarded per question depends on the difficulty of the game; 400 points per easy question, 800 points per medium question, and 1200 points per hard question.
